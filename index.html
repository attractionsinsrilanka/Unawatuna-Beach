		Unawatuna is a coastal town in Galle district of Sri Lanka. Unawatuna is a major tourist attraction in Sri Lanka and known for its beach and corals. It is a suburb of Galle, about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) southeast to the city center and approximately 108 kilometres (67 mi) south of Colombo. Unawatuna is situated at an elevation of 5 metres (16 ft) above the sea level. Despite significant development in the last decade it is still home to the endangered and endemic purple-faced langur, an usually shy monkey species that can only be found in Sri Lanka's forests. The remnant population in Unawatuna needs to be recognised and the remaining forest cover should be protected to preserve this beautiful creature. This will in turn provide unique opportunities for eco-tourism that will benefit all local communities and stakeholders as well as the environment and ecology.
